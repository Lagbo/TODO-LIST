# #STEPS TO LEARNING PYTHON  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

# # Comment(type of comment in python and how to declare them)

# #meaning of is in shell navigate in vs code manual

# # debugging: its for error and how we fix this error problem


# #STEP 1: VALUES(ALPHABET AND NUMBERS)
# # values can be of two types
# #@alphabet and number


# print("what is your name, write it in string alphabet in python as out put  ")
# print("lawrence")
# print(4)

# print("what is your name, write it in string alphabet in python as out put  ")
# print("agbo")


# print(
#     "lawrence",
#     566657
# )

# print(2)

#this is for debugging errors

#print(oche)

#STEP2 DATA TYPES AND THEIR BOX(SYNTANX)

# we talk about the box or container game in coding 

#data types are the real ideal to boxing the container in python

# print(
#     "Agbo",

#     2,

#     (5,4,"mary","sam"),

#     ["rice","beans",7,8,9],

#     {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 30,
#     "is_employee": True,
#     "skills": ["Python", "Data Engineering", "Software Development"]},
#     True
# )


# data types or container and their symbol or shape

# step 2 data types (the box are there syntax)

# "" for string  "Agbo",
# number has no box  2
# () for set (5,4,"mary","sam"),
# [] for list ["rice","beans",7,8,9]
# # {} for dictionary
# {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 30,
#     "is_employee": True,
#     "skills": ["Python", "Data Engineering", "Software Development"]},

# boolean either true or false
# the print() is a built in function or method in python and they are two types of function  

# the two types of function in python (1) inbuilt function (2) self built function by the programmer

# print (
#     "Agbo",
#     2,
#     {2,4,"mary","john"},
#      {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 30,
#     "is_employee": True,
#     "skills": ["Python", "Data Engineering", "Software Development"]},
     
#      True

#     )




# STEP 3 VARIBALE AND HOW TO DECLARE THEM

# Variables are container holder in python and variables name can be anything and they  hold value information we want to display as output 

#assignment learn about variables, learn how to declare variables in python and their rules on how to declare them 

name =  "agbo"
age = 100
set_num = ("agbo", 2, 4, "lawrence")
list_num = [2,4,7, "agbo"]
print(name)
print(age)
print(set_num)
print(list_num)


# assignment write about dictionary, tupple and boolean 
# types of numbers data type in python
# variables rules in python and how to declare them 

# STEP 4
# HOW TO PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
